# christmasWishesApp

This APi is designed to interact with a database to update children's Christmas lists.

Users can create profiles, and then add things to their lists. The efficiency comes from being able to first create an item that will appear as an option for anyone to add to their list. This allows for consistency in the database because there are specific items that can be added to each list.
Once items have been added to the database for selection you can put them on your list. This design allows the admin to see how many of each toy need to be manufactured and then where they need to go.
